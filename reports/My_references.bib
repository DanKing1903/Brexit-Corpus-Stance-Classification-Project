  title = {A {{Literature Survey}} on {{Algorithms}} for {{Multi}}-Label {{Learning}}},
  abstract = {Multi-label Learning is a form of supervised learning where the classification algorithm is required to learn from a set of instances, each instance can belong to multiple classes and so after be able to predict a set of class labels for a new instance. This is a generalized version of most popular multi-class problems where each instances is restricted to have only one class label. There exists a wide range of applications for multi-labelled predictions, such as text categorization, semantic image labeling, gene functionality classification etc. and the scope and interest is increasing with modern applications. This survey paper introduces the task of multi-label prediction (classification), presents the sparse literature in this area in an organized manner, discusses different evaluation metrics and performs a comparative analysis of the existing algorithms. This paper also relates multi-label problems with similar but different problems that are often reduced to multi-label problems to have access to wide range of multi-label algorithms.},

We also explore to what extent language users agree about what kind of stances are expressed in natural language use or whether their interpretations diverge. In order to perform this task, a comprehensive cognitive-functional framework of ten stance categories was developed based on previous work on speaker stance in the literature. A corpus of opinionated texts was compiled, the Brexit Blog Corpus (BBC). An analytical protocol and interface (Active Learning and Visual Analytics) for the annotations was set up and the data were independently annotated by two annotators. The annotation procedure, the annotation agreements and the co-occurrence of more than one stance in the utterances are described and discussed. The careful, analytical annotation process has returned satisfactory inter- and intra-annotation agreement scores, resulting in a gold standard corpus, the final version of the BBC.},

Based on our previous work on stance and our findings on stance patterns, we detected stance-related characteristics in a data set from Twitter and Facebook. We extracted various corpus-, quantitative- and computational-based features that proved to be significant for six stance categories (contrariety, hypotheticality, necessity, prediction, source of knowledge, and uncertainty), and we tested them in our data set. The results of a preliminary clustering method are presented and discussed as a starting point for future contributions in the field. The results of our experiments showed a strong correlation between different characteristics and stance constructions, which can lead us to a methodology for automatic stance annotation of these data.},

  abstract = {The use of interactive visualization techniques in Digital Humanities research can be a useful addition when traditional automated machine learning techniques face difficulties, as is often the case with the exploration of large volumes of dynamic\textemdash{}and in many cases, noisy and conflicting\textemdash{}textual data from social media. Recently, the field of stance analysis has been moving from a predominantly binary approach\textemdash{}either pro or con\textemdash{}to a multifaceted one, where each unit of text may be classified as one (or more) of multiple possible stance categories. This change adds more layers of complexity to an already hard problem, but also opens up new opportunities for obtaining richer and more relevant results from the analysis of stancetaking in social media. In this paper we propose StanceXplore, a new visualization for the interactive exploration of stance in social media. Our goal is to offer DH researchers the chance to explore stance-classified text corpora from different perspectives at the same time, using coordinated multiple views including user-defined topics, content similarity and dissimilarity, and geographical and temporal distribution. As a case study, we explore the activity of Twitter users in Sweden, analyzing their behavior in terms of topics discussed and the stances taken. Each textual unit (tweet) is labeled with one of eleven stance categories from a cognitive-functional stance framework based on recent work. We illustrate how StanceXplore can be used effectively to investigate multidimensional patterns and trends in stance-taking related to cultural events, their geographical distribution, and the confidence of the stance classifier.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a formally driven quantitative analysis of stance-annotated sentences in the Brexit Blog Corpus (BBC). Our goal is to identify features that determine the formal profiles of six stance categories (CONTRARIETY, HYPOTHETICALITY, NECESSITY, PREDICTION, SOURCE OF KNOWLEDGE and UNCERTAINTY) in a subset of the BBC. The study has two parts: firstly, it examines a large number of formal linguistic features, such as punctuation, words and grammatical categories that occur in the sentences in order to describe the specific characteristics of each category, and secondly, it compares characteristics in the entire data set in order to determine stance similarities in the data set. We show that among the six stance categories in the corpus, CONTRARIETY and NECESSITY are the most discriminative ones, with the former using longer sentences, more conjunctions, more repetitions and shorter forms than the sentences expressing other stances. NECESSITY has longer lexical forms but shorter sentences, which are syntactically more complex. We show that stance in our data set is expressed in sentences with around 21 words per sentence. The sentences consist mainly of alphabetical characters forming a varied vocabulary without special forms, such as digits or special characters.},

  doi = {10.1109/ICCAR.2017.7942788},
  abstract = {Unstructured text data produced on the internet grows rapidly, and sentiment analysis for short texts becomes a challenge because of the limit of the contextual information they usually contain. Learning good vector representations for sentences is a challenging task and an ongoing research area. Moreover, learning long-term dependencies with gradient descent is difficult in neural network language model because of the vanishing gradients problem. Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems traditionally treat words as discrete atomic symbols; the model can leverage small amounts of information regarding the relationship between the individual symbols. In this paper, we propose ConvLstm, neural network architecture that employs Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) on top of pre-trained word vectors. In our experiments, ConvLstm exploit LSTM as a substitute of pooling layer in CNN to reduce the loss of detailed local information and capture long term dependencies in sequence of sentences. We validate the proposed model on two sentiment datasets IMDB, and Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SSTb). Empirical results show that ConvLstm achieved comparable performances with less parameters on sentiment analysis tasks.},

  title = {On {{Over}}-fitting in {{Model Selection}} and {{Subsequent Selection Bias}} in {{Performance Evaluation}}},
  abstract = {Model selection strategies for machine learning algorithms typically involve the numerical optimisation of an appropriate model selection criterion, often based on an estimator of generalisation performance, such as k-fold cross-validation. The error of such an estimator can be broken down into bias and variance components. While unbiasedness is often cited as a beneficial quality of a model selection criterion, we demonstrate that a low variance is at least as important, as a nonnegligible variance introduces the potential for over-fitting in model selection as well as in training the model. While this observation is in hindsight perhaps rather obvious, the degradation in performance due to over-fitting the model selection criterion can be surprisingly large, an observation that appears to have received little attention in the machine learning literature to date. In this paper, we show that the effects of this form of over-fitting are often of comparable magnitude to differences in performance between learning algorithms, and thus cannot be ignored in empirical evaluation. Furthermore, we show that some common performance evaluation practices are susceptible to a form of selection bias as a result of this form of over-fitting and hence are unreliable. We discuss methods to avoid over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, which we hope will be incorporated into best practice. While this study concentrates on cross-validation based model selection, the findings are quite general and apply to any model selection practice involving the optimisation of a model selection criterion evaluated over a finite sample of data, including maximisation of the Bayesian evidence and optimisation of performance bounds.},

  title = {Illiberal {{Democracy}}: {{The Toxic Mix}} of {{Fake News}}, {{Hyperpolarization}}, and {{Partisan Election Administration}}},
  shorttitle = {Illiberal {{Democracy}}},
  abstract = {The 2016 presidential election shook American democracy to its foundations. From Russia's hacking of Democratic National Committee emails to President Trump's false allegations of widespread voting fraud, America's democratic institutions emerged from the election battered and bruised. The stunning turn of events and the unprecedented controversy that surrounded the election had a profound impact on public opinion. National surveys now consistently find that a majority of Americans question the integrity of the nation's election system. Accordingly, this article contends that we have entered into a dangerous new chapter in the nation's history that not only threatens public confidence in election fairness but potentially could even undermine the long-term health of the nation's democracy. The unjustified fear of election fraud has itself become a threat to America's democratic principles. This article identifies three toxic developments that if left unchecked threaten the future of voting rights in America. The first is the rise of fake news. As the traditional news media has lost its gate-keeper status and as the internet has facilitated the rapid spread of misinformation, false allegations of voting fraud dominate news cycles. The pervasive nature of the claims has triggered a precipitous decline in public confidence in election integrity, even though there is no factual basis to justify the public's fear of widespread fraud. The second is the phenomenon of hyperpolarization. The partisan divide has reached such historic levels that Republicans and Democrats increasingly view the opposing party as a threat to the nation's well-being. Hyperpolarization makes partisans more inclined to attempt to limit the political influence of opposing voters, a development that is particularly dangerous in the United States because of the third toxic feature of contemporary politics: partisan control of election administration. Unusual among major democracies, the United States entrusts the majority party with responsibility for administering elections and setting voting rules. In recent years partisans have become increasingly aggressive in adopting election laws that benefit one party at the expense of the other. The real scandal of American politics is not illegal vote rigging or voter fraud but rather the extent to which partisans are legally permitted to manipulate election rules for political advantage.The United States thus stands at a uniquely dangerous moment in its history. The risk that America may evolve into an illiberal democracy is particularly high in light of the ongoing battle over voter registration restrictions and other laws that limit access to voting. In the name of safeguarding election integrity, legislatures across the country have adopted new voting laws that many courts and scholars have concluded make it harder for poor and minority voters to participate in the democratic process. As Americans increasingly view election stakes in apocalyptic terms, as false allegations of election fraud spread like wildfire, and as partisan officials control election rules, America's democratic institutions face their most serious domestic challenge since the enactment of the Voting Rights Act in 1965. This article concludes by proposing three steps to defend and preserve the vitality of America's liberal democratic norms at this dangerous moment in the nation's history.},

Here for the first time we present a dataset of tweet--target pairs annotated for both stance and sentiment. The targets may or may not be referred to in the tweets, and they may or may not be the target of opinion in the tweets. Partitions of this dataset were used as training and test sets in a SemEval-2016 shared task competition. We propose a simple stance detection system that outperforms submissions from all 19 teams that participated in the shared task. Additionally, access to both stance and sentiment annotations allows us to explore several research questions. We show that while knowing the sentiment expressed by a tweet is beneficial for stance classification, it alone is not sufficient. Finally, we use additional unlabeled data through distant supervision techniques and word embeddings to further improve stance classification.},

We experiment with conditional LSTM encoding, which builds a representation of the tweet that is dependent on the target, and demonstrate that it outperforms encoding the tweet and the target independently. Performance is improved further when the conditional model is augmented with bidirectional encoding. We evaluate our approach on the SemEval 2016 Task 6 Twitter Stance Detection corpus achieving performance second best only to a system trained on semiautomatically labelled tweets for the test target. When such weak supervision is added, our approach achieves state\textendash{}of-the-art results.},

  abstract = {While most approaches to automatically recognizing entailment relations have used classifiers employing hand engineered features derived from complex natural language processing pipelines, in practice their performance has been only slightly better than bag-of-word pair classifiers using only lexical similarity. The only attempt so far to build an end-to-end differentiable neural network for entailment failed to outperform such a simple similarity classifier. In this paper, we propose a neural model that reads two sentences to determine entailment using long short-term memory units. We extend this model with a word-by-word neural attention mechanism that encourages reasoning over entailments of pairs of words and phrases. Furthermore, we present a qualitative analysis of attention weights produced by this model, demonstrating such reasoning capabilities. On a large entailment dataset this model outperforms the previous best neural model and a classifier with engineered features by a substantial margin. It is the first generic end-to-end differentiable system that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on a textual entailment dataset.},

Central to the volume is the claim that stancetaking encompasses five general principles: it involves physical, attitudinal and/or moral positioning; it is a public action; it is inherently dialogic, interactional, and sequential; it indexes broader sociocultural contexts; and it is consequential to the interactants. Each paper explores one or more of these dimensions of stance from perspectives including interactional linguistics and conversation analysis, corpus linguistics, language description, discourse analysis, and sociocultural linguistics. Research languages include conversational American English, colloquial Indonesian, and Finnish. The understanding of stance that emerges is heterogeneous and variegated, and always intertwined with the pragmatic and social aspects of human conduct.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Thereafter, we reflect on its strengths and weaknesses, clarify the functional (effect-centric vs. analytic-abstractive) level and consider its many implications for cognitive research and theorising. In the final section, we briefly review the articles contained in this Special Issue. These contributions provide clear examples of the conceptual, empirical and methodological developments that can emerge when cognitive, clinical, personality and neuroscientists fully engage with the functional-cognitive perspective.},

The attention is learned on a training set of labeled samples to ensure that, given a text sequence, the relevant words are weighted higher than the irrelevant ones. Our method maintains the interpretability of word embeddings, and enjoys a built-in ability to leverage alternative sources of information, in addition to input text sequences. Extensive results on the several large text datasets show that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, in terms of both accuracy and speed.},

Many successful applications of machine learning exist already, including systems that analyze past sales data to predict customer behavior, optimize robot behavior so that a task can be completed using minimum resources, and extract knowledge from bioinformatics data. Introduction to Machine Learning is a comprehensive textbook on the subject, covering a broad array of topics not usually included in introductory machine learning texts. Subjects include supervised learning; Bayesian decision theory; parametric, semi-parametric, and nonparametric methods; multivariate analysis; hidden Markov models; reinforcement learning; kernel machines; graphical models; Bayesian estimation; and statistical testing.Machine learning is rapidly becoming a skill that computer science students must master before graduation. The third edition of Introduction to Machine Learning reflects this shift, with added support for beginners, including selected solutions for exercises and additional example data sets (with code available online). Other substantial changes include discussions of outlier detection; ranking algorithms for perceptrons and support vector machines; matrix decomposition and spectral methods; distance estimation; new kernel algorithms; deep learning in multilayered perceptrons; and the nonparametric approach to Bayesian methods. All learning algorithms are explained so that students can easily move from the equations in the book to a computer program. The book can be used by both advanced undergraduates and graduate students. It will also be of interest to professionals who are concerned with the application of machine learning methods.},

  abstract = {Machine Learning has become a key enabling technology for many engineering applications and theoretical problems alike. To further discussions and to dis- minate new results, a Summer School was held on February 11\textendash{}22, 2002 at the Australian National University. The current book contains a collection of the main talks held during those two weeks in February, presented as tutorial chapters on topics such as Boosting, Data Mining, Kernel Methods, Logic, Reinforcement Learning, and Statistical Learning Theory. The papers provide an in-depth overview of these exciting new areas, contain a large set of references, and thereby provide the interested reader with further information to start or to pursue his own research in these directions. Complementary to the book, a recorded video of the presentations during the Summer School can be obtained at http://mlg. anu. edu. au/summer2002 It is our hope that graduate students, lecturers, and researchers alike will ?nd this book useful in learning and teaching Machine Learning, thereby continuing the mission of the Summer School.

This article introduces the task of multi-label classification, organizes the sparse related literature into a structured presentation and performs comparative experimental results of certain multilabel classification methods. It also contributes the definition of concepts for the quantification of the multi-label nature of a data set.},

  abstract = {A large body of research in supervised learning deals with the analysis of single-label data, where training examples are associated with a single label $\lambda$ from a set of disjoint labels L. However, training examples in several application domains are often associated with a set of labels Y $\subseteq$ L. Such data are called multi-label.Textual data, such as documents and web pages, are frequently annotated with more than a single label. For example, a news article concerning the reactions of the Christian church to the release of the ``Da Vinci Code'' film can be labeled as both religion and movies. The categorization of textual data is perhaps the dominant multi-label application.},
