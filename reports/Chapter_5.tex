\section{Introduction}
In this chapter the performance of the models developed is evaluated and compared. The chapter begins with a description of the hyper-parameter tuning process employed for the final FastText models, before the results for each model are presented. Finally, the chapter concludes with an quantitative analysis of model performance and qualitative review of predictions using the anchoring method described in section ??.
